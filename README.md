# What are Learning Pods?

Learning pods is a Kumar for Congress program designed to give students an in-person learning experience through the pandemic. The website and project is led and designed by high school students, who are interns of the Congressional Candidate Rishi Kumar.

This project is sponsored by Rishi Kumar, a Congressional Candidate aiming to help our community during this pandemic. Kumar is a Saratoga Councilmember running for Congressman of CA-D18 this year. Kumar sponsored and started this project to help empower youth and give them a new, in-person learning opportunity during the pandemic.

We wish to give back to the community and help out with our community's needs. This was one of the way's we could think of.
